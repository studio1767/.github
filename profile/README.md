# Studio 1767

I've worked in a number of small vfx studios over the years and there are often some key missing 
tools and technologies. I've had to find or build solutions to the same problems multiple times
so I'm working through my notes and converting them into working systems and software in the hope
that this will be the last time...

Putting them out here on github in case they're useful for others as well.
